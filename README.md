# 🕵️‍♀️ VERIS-MITRE Mapping Analyzer 🕵️‍♂️
## Knowledge Graph Shenanigans in Rust inspired by IBM's adoption for it's QM Framework, Qiskit. As well as the  work done on kgcreation in Py

## 🚀 Project Overview

Welcome to the VERIS-MITRE Mapping Analyzer! 🎉 BLAZING FAST (I think this makes tests run) Rust 🦀 project connects the dotsbetween VERIS and MITRE ATT&CK. It's like CSI for cyber threats! 🔍💻

Sadly no support for MITRE Atlas (Adversarial AI vectors) but we'll build toward that 

### What it does:
- 📊 Loads VERIS-MITRE mapping data
- 🕸️ Builds a super awesome graph
- 🧮 Crunches numbers like a boss
- 📈 Spits out analysis results in all your favourite formats

Requires a set of bindings between frameworks predefined. I think a synthetic data effort and 50 manuals could be useful.

## 🃏 Modelling Novel Threats with Graphs

Graphs aren't just for math nerds anymore! 🤓 We're using them to:

- 🕷️ Weave a web of connections between threats
- 🔮 Predict the search space for novel attacks
- 🧩 Get ahead pfof emerging attack patterns
- 👷‍♂️ Building a connecter to opencti
- ✅ Attempted to stay with ECS but no schema enforcement yet


## 🎨 Metadata Augmentation and Summary

- 🏷️ Tagging threats with extra juicy details
- 📊 Summarizing data using LLM and eventually specialized SLM.
- 🔬 Zooming in on the nitty-gritty of each threat

It's metadata on steroids! 💪📚

## 🔮 TBD (To Be Developed)
- Schema enforcement ELK Stack Use
- Mitre Atlas integration
- LLM Summary and population of more metadata
  - RAG leveraging this data from "intelligence reports."

The future is bright, and so is our roadmap! 🌟

- 🤖 AI-powered threat prediction
- 🌐 Real-time threat intelligence integration
- 🎮 Gamified threat modeling (because why not?)

Have the fun!! 📺✨
